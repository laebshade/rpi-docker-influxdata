Telegraf builds for Raspberry Pi 3
==================================
Currently Telegraf 1.3.3 on Raspbian Jesse and Alpine 3.6. The builds are pretty straightforward since InfluxData have armhf releases. See [mjenz/rpi-telegraf on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjenz/rpi-telegraf/) for build details and [telegraf on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/telegraf/) for usage instructions.
I don't actually use this any more so can't guarantee it will stay updated.
