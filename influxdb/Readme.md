InfluxDB builds for Raspberry Pi 3
==================================
Currently InfluxDB 1.2.4 on Raspbian Jesse and Alpine 3.6. The builds are pretty straightforward since InfluxData have armhf releases. See [mjenz/rpi-influxdb on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjenz/rpi-influxdb/) for built containers and [influxdb on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/) for usage instructions.
I don't actually use this any more so can't guarantee it will stay updated.
