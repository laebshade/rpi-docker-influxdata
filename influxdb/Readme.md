InfluxDB builds for Raspberry Pi 3
==================================
Currently just InfluxDB 1.1.1 on Raspbian Jesse and Alpine 3.4. The builds are pretty straightforward since InfluxData have armhf releases. See [mjenz/rpi-influxdb on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mjenz/rpi-influxdb/) for built containers and [influxdb on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/) for usage instructions.
